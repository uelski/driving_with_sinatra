Pair Programming by building a Sinatra Server

## Instructions 

- Create an app.rb, config.ru, and Gemfile
- For each file, switch turns with your partner
- One of you will navigate: 'explain what to do'
- The other will drive: 'write the code'
- In your app.rb, create a '/' route
- Return a Hash.to_json of data about your team
- Create two additional routes
- '/first_person' and '/second_person'
- These routes should return a hash to json about each person
- Upon completion, test and verify all 3 routes work!
- Git add, commit, push!
